# Task-Man

The purpose of the application is to allow users to easily track and manage tasks.
• User signup by providing username and password.
• Login to his account by providing an username and password.
• A logged in user should be able to perform the following tasks:
➡ See all tasks created,
➡ Add a new task by providing Task Name, status & priority,
➡ Mark tasks as complete,
➡ Mark completed tasks as incomplete,
➡ Delete existing tasks,
➡ All task activities by a user are to be tracked and can be viewed in the form of an activity feed. For. e.g. If a user deletes a task the activity feed should have "Username perform delete operation". 
• Used core django components like templates, forms to develop TaskMan.
